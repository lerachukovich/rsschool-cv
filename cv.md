## About me
About floor of year ago I've decided to learn Front-End Development. I don't have a lot of experience yet, but I have a great desire to develop in this area. So my goal is to become a developer. I think one of my strongest points is a responsibility. 
 
## Skills
My experience includes following technologies:
* _Web languages:_ HTML, CSS, JavaScript(beginner).
* _Design Tools:_ Photoshop, Illustrator, Avocode, Figma.
* _CSS Frameworks:_ Bootstrap.
* _Preprocessors:_ Less.
* _Systems of version control:_ Git.
 
## Experience
I don't have any commercial experience yet. I finished a course [Learn programming with JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5664271-learn-programming-by-practicing-javascript) at Openclassrooms.
Currently I take a course [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) at Udemy.
